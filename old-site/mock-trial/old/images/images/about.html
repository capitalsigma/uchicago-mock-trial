    <h2>ABOUT MOCK TRIAL</h2>
  </section>
  
  <section id="right-block1" class="rightblock">
    <H6>What does Mock Trial do?</H6>
    <p> Mock Trial reenacts the argument of a case at the trial level in the fictional state of Midlands. Each team takes a side in the case - either the prosecution for criminal cases and plaintiff for defense cases, or the defendant - and divides its members into teams, each made up of attorneys and witnesses. Each team usually has around 10 members.</p>
        
    <p><b>Attorneys</b> help to advance the case through opening and closing statements, by directly questioning the witnesses on their side, and destroying the credibility of witnessses on the other side by cross-examining them.  </p>
    
    <p>It's the <b>witnesses'</b> job, then, to bolster their side of the case by fending off the aggressive and revealing questions of the other attorney. This is where acting becomes important. A grieving mother or knavish journalist presented with convincing, lifelike emotion may win the judges over to give us an indisputable victory.</p>
    
    <p>The entire trial is subject, of course, to constraints that make it both challenging and fun. Witnesses must stay on script: that is, their story or evidence must be consistent with what is written in their <i>affidavit</i> (basically a written testimony) in the case materials provided by the American Mock Trial Association. Both sides must pay careful attention to the Rules of Evidence, which governs what questions and answers each party may ask and give.</p>
    
    <p>At the college level, Mock Trial is different from similar high school competitions. In short, the rules are stricter, not all objections are available, and there are some changes in terminology. Ask any of our executive officers if you would like to know more about the differences in rules.</p>
    
    
    <H6>How do we win?</H6>
    <p>Winning, my dear freshman, is hardly important in the honorable and chivalrous competition that is Mock Trial.</p>
    <p>Oh wait. Just kidding. Unlike a typical court case where one side is declared victorious or an appellate court moot where both a winner on the law and a winner on merit are chosen, mock trials are only judged based on merit. Two judges score each round and give up to 10 points to each component of the trial. The points are then totalled and the team with more points wins. Ties are also possible.</p>

    <h2>MOCK TRIAL AT UCHICAGO</h2>
  </section>
  
  <section id="right-block2" class="rightblock">
    <p>Mock Trial at UChicago is an award-winning program that trains its members in the arts of rhetoric, argument, and even acting. Each team is placed with a coach, who may be a law school student or a recent gradaute of the program and so a veteran mocker. Our competition season is divided into three periods.</p>
    <p>In the <b>Fall Quarter</b> we compete in tournaments around the Midwest after teams are decided upon by the Board. Traditionally, Mock Trial at UChicago travels to Macalester College in St. Paul, MN to compete (and eat at Olive Garden afterwards - that is key). Last season, a team also traveled to the University of Iowa's Cornshucker tournament.</p>
    <p>A descent into the bitter cold of the <b>Winter Quarter</b> finds our urge to win blazing ever stronger. Our teams compete for a place in <i>ORCS</i>, the American Mock Trial Association's regional competitions. To do this, we travel to tournaments - even as far away as Rochester, NY last year - and vanquish the opposition to earn a precious ticket to the regionals. In an incredible feat last season, all four of our teams qualified for ORCS.</p>
    <p>When <b>spring</b> rolls around (says the calendar; in Chicago it snows in May) we compete in the National Championships. We placed second in the Nationals last year, yet another record for the program. Other activities in this more relaxed quarter include Mockball, the annual softball tournament against other UChicago teams and houses.</p>
